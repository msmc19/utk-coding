# utk-coding
All prior work I've done coding-wise from UTK

Much of this work is past work so this doesn't fully reflect my current capabilities
I've diverted away from Java / C++ recently, so I'm proficient in the basic functions needed.
I'm pursuing other languages which I will provide later once I've worked enough in such.
